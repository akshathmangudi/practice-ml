This repository contains my work to learn and practice ML. 

During these holidays, I have taken the initiative, to rediscover Machine Learning, and explore the 
fundamentals, starting from the basics of Python and Numpy and all the way to Deep Learning. I will 
rediscover scikit-learn and Keras as well as re-learn the fundamentals such as Bias/Variance, 
ML debugging, and methods of statistical learning. 

Why am I doing this? 

Mainly to just rediscover the foundations and be crystal clear on them. This will be one of many 
things that I plan on doing.
